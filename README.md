# TextMining-NER
This is a text mining project that has a name entity recognition goal. I developed this project together with three other colleagues. We used the famous 'Wikigold' dataset that contains 145 wikipedia documents manually annotated using the conll format. 
For this project we use mainly two architectures: the first one uses Recurrent neural network (RNN) and it is the so called LSTM; the second one is a transformer based approach and it is BERT.
